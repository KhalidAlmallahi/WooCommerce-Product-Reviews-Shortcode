# WooCommerce: Display Product Reviews @ Custom Page (Shortcode)

WooCommerce product reviews shows by default in the “Reviews” tab in the single product page. But what if, like me, you’re using custom sales pages and need to show such reviews elsewhere – by using a shortcode?

Once the snippet below is added to your functions.php, simply use shortcode [product_reviews id="123"] anywhere you like. Please note “id” is the ID of the product for which you want to output customer reviews.

# Note:
This code add into function.php theme
